This is a frontend for the [MineCrash backend](https://github.com/Eimer-Archive/MineCrashService) in the form of a discord bot that is easy and quick to use. It takes in commands containing your error/log as plain text or a .txt file and sends it to the backend and returns the solution as a message in your server. 

## FAQ

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome.

### Setup

#### Requirements

To get started with contributing or setting your own bot up you must have Java 22 installed and a discord bot with its token.

#### Running

To run the bot you just do it like any normal Java program `java -jar discordbot.jar`. To add the token either you can modify the code or input it in the program arguments.

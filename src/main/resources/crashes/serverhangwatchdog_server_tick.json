  "solution": "A plugin/mod may be causing the server to lag a lot so it was killed by Minecraft. Try disabling the plugin/mod, if you don't know which one is causing the problem, try disabling all plugins/mods and then re-enabling them one by one or in groups until you find it. Another solution is disabling this feature, you can go into the `server.properties` and find `max-tick-time` and set it to `-1`. If these don't solve the issue try checking the server log instead. This can happen often with WorldEdit if you make extremely large edits."
